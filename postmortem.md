Approach and Process
1) What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

    I would want to design exactly what sort of functions/features the game would need, before I implement the main code structure that houses all these functions. 
    
    Initially, I was able to successfully implement the logic code that draws data, which is housed in an entirely separate javascript file (gameData). In doing so, gave me the flexibility to make an infinite amount of "rooms" with irregardless of the amount of buttons or text. The code also allowed me to dictate the subsequent rooms by editing purely on my gameData file, expanding the storyline/game in the process. These were the minimum features I decided on before I started.

    The problem came, when I needed to expand these set of features, to more divs/unique buttons that call on different functions. Implementing the "battle mechanism" proved to be more complicated as I did not consider further features that were to be added. I would want to thoroughly think of the big picture and leaving room for better expandability/maintainability in my next project.



What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?


    I started to check various functions and their selector values in order to keep track what was going on. Commenting at different junctions definitely help organise and point which functions were doing which. These helped me to better maintain my code and point out malfunctioning codes during debugging.

Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

    I would want to attempt callback functions and return values, as well as using parameters in functions to help in conditionals loops. These were things I unknowingly avoided during the process.

What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

    I was able to
